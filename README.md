Alright, I need to create a README for the '64. IoT weather' project. Let's start with the title. The user wants it under 50 characters. Since it's an IoT project involving weather monitoring and control, maybe "IoT Weather Monitoring & Alert System" fits. Let me check the character count... Yeah, that's 42 characters. Good.

Next is the description. The project uses C/C++, Arduino, and Proton Basic. From the code snippets, it looks like it involves sensors for smoke/gas, temperature, and sound. The IoThome.bas file reads these sensors and controls relays based on thresholds. The WebHome.c seems to handle GSM communication to send data to a server. So the description should mention real-time monitoring, sensors used, relay control for safety, and data transmission to a web server. Also note the hardware setup with a microcontroller, LCD, and GSM module.

Now, the pinmap. Looking at the IoThome.bas: LCD pins on PORTB.1, .2, .4. Sensors and relays on PORTC. For example, sound sensor on PORTC.0, relays on PORTC.1-3. In WebHome.c, LCD uses different pins on PORTB (RB2-RB7), sensors on PORTC.0, .1, relays on RC2-RC5. Need to outline this, but since there are different configurations in the two files, should I merge them or note the differences? The user says the diagram may not be accurate. Maybe present a combined table but mention that pins might vary.

List the sensors and their pins: Smoke/Gas (AN0, PORTA.0), Temperature (AN1, PORTA.1), Sound (PORTC.0), Vibrations (PORTC.1 if used). Relays for exhaust, cooling, alarm on PORTC.1-3. LCD on PORTB. GSM on UART1 with Tx/Rx not specified, maybe default pins?

Then in the code structure, mention the two main files: IoThome.bas for sensor reading and local control, WebHome.c for GSM communication and data logging. Note that one uses Proton Basic for the PIC16F73 and the other is C for presumably another microcontroller.

Need to add a note about the diagram's accuracy. Also list the PDF files provided by the user, but they didn't include any, so maybe skip that part or omit it since there are no PDFs listed. 

Avoid contribution and license info as instructed. Don't add sections for those. Make sure to not include markdown formatting as per the initial request. Wait, no, the user did want the README in markdown, just the answer here in natural text. Wait, no, looking back, the user wants me to "Generate a README file..." so the final answer should be markdown, but the thinking process is natural text.

Let me structure the README step by step. Title, description, pinmap, code structure, note on diagram. Check if all points are covered. Ensure pinmap is clear and warnings about discrepancies are present. Code overview explains each file's role. Anything else? Prerequisites maybe, but user didn't ask. Maybe hardware components? But the user didn't specify beyond the code. Better to stick to what's given. Okay, that should cover all requirements.

# IoT Weather Monitoring & Alert System (64. IoT Weather)

## Description  
This project implements an IoT-based environmental monitoring system using a PIC microcontroller (16F73) with C/C++/Proton Basic code. It integrates smoke/gas, temperature, and sound sensors to enable real-time safety alerts. Sensor data is displayed on an LCD, triggers relay-controlled actuators (exhaust fan, cooling system, alarm), and transmits to a remote server via GSM for cloud logging.

## Pin Configuration  
| Component       | Pin(s)          | Notes                          |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| **LCD (4-bit)** | RS: RB1, EN: RB2, Data: RB4 | Configured via 4-bit interface |
| **Sensors**     |                 |                                |
| Smoke/Gas       | AN0 (PORTA.0)   | MCP3201 ADC input              |
| Temperature     | AN1 (PORTA.1)   | Linearized to °C               |
| Sound           | PORTC.0         | Digital input                  |
| Vibrations      | PORTC.1*        | _(Code commented out)_         |
| **Relays**      |                 |                                |
| Exhaust Fan     | PORTC.1         | Activated if smoke >50 PPM     |
| Cooling System  | PORTC.2         | Activated if temperature >27°C|
| Alarm           | PORTC.3         | Triggered by sound detection   |
| **GSM Module**  | UART1 (Tx/Rx)   | Default microcontroller pins   |

**Note:** Pin mappings may vary between `IoThome.bas` and `WebHome.c` - verify against actual hardware.

## Code Overview  
### `IoThome.bas` (Proton Basic)
- Configures PIC16F73 with HS oscillator (10MHz)
- Implements:  
  - Analog sensor reading (smoke/gas, temp)
  - Threshold-based relay control logic  
  - LCD output formatting (smoke in PPM, temp in °C)  
  - Serial data output (9600 baud) for external devices

### `WebHome.c` (C - PIC Microcontroller)
- Manages GSM communication via SIM800 module
- Sends HTTP GET requests to cloud server with parameters:  
  ```php
  ?g_value=<smoke>&v_value=<vibrations>&s_value=<sound>
  ```
- Features UART interrupt handling for bidirectional GSM communication

⚠️ **Hardware Note**: Schematics in code may require adjustments for specific module variants. Always verify connections with actual component datasheets.
